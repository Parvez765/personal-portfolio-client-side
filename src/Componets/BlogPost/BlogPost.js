            <p>Currently, React JS is the most widely used framework for creating web applications in the web development sector. <br/>Basically, this framework goes a long way in giving a flexible, user-friendly look to the frontend of web applications. <br/>Jordan Waki, a software developer at Facebook, invented this framework in 2013, which is now being used by giant companies <br/>including Google to build their single page applications.<br/><br/>React JS is a front-end base framework built primarily with JavaScript and can be used to easily build component-based single page applications.<br/> In addition, the biggest advantage of React is that it is component-based and does not have to repeat the same code over and over again.<br/> As a result, if developers want to write code in a central place, they can easily use it wherever they need. <br/><br/>
            Apart from this, the other benefits that make React JS so popular are:<br/>
                -It speeds up rendering of websites through virtual DOM creation<br/>
                - This framework has a strong community for this reason a quick solution to any problem can be solved easily<br/>
                - Can create customized components<br/><br/>
                Besides, this framework has many advantages which is one of the main reason to increase it's popularity day by day<br/>
                    It is better to say that the social media site that you or I are using now is built with React JSðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
